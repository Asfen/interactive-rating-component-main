## Overview

This is an interactive page for giving a rating. Made without the use of html form rather just use of radio buttons for rating selection. Made be a novice developer who is trying to learn frontend development.

### The challenge

-This project was fun to build but took some time to get css correct to look right

-js was trivial but took some time to figure out there is no need to add listener for the radio buttons.

## My process

- I started with html. Made two divs for rating part and submitted part each.

- Got the style detail form style guide and linked and worked on css for rating part.

- after completing rating part made it display none and worked on thank you part.

- After I was okey with the design Added js code and completed the project.

- Took me some time to figure out I can just select checked radio button on JS and get its value Making the js code a lot simpler.

- Finalized some design problem that popped up after js change display setting to make required part visible.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS custom properties

- Flexbox

- CSS Grid

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Of course, I always find something new or act different on CSS side of things. learned about :checked pseudo class. auto margin for center grid element with content fit.

First practical use of js was this project. I realized I was far behind. And jumped on js learning spree and put this project on hold for a week.

I learned few things I had no idea before. I couldn't even easily google and get answers.

Things like Linking js code just before the closing body tag. Not doing so caused a lot of problem and ate few hours of my time.

Different selectors on js needed for different case.

I learned to use devtool to know what went wrong when suddenly my buttons and input stop working. Without the tools I would have had no idea what went wrong.
